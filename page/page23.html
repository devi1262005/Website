            <p>The eye sees it all,<br>
                Of the lovers in bush,<br>
                The lovers that hush,<br>
                The lovers from crush,<br>
                The lovers that rush.</p>
<br>
            <p>The lovers who are unafraid,<br>
                Finding joy in being known,<br>
                The lovers that find strength to fight,<br>
                The lovers that find strength to hide.</p>
<br>
            <p>The lovers together for sake,<br>
                Conceiving a child at everyone's wake,<br>
                The lovers that learn to love,<br>
                As they call it fate.</p>
<br>
            <p>The lovers whose love might kill,<br>
                The lovers whose love is a known tragedy,<br>
                The lovers that indulge in love,<br>
                The lovers who rewrite their fate, holding hands.</p>
<br>
            <p>The lovers who part,<br>
                Still in disbelief of their depart,<br>
                The lovers who let go,<br>
                The lovers who immortalize.</p>
<br>
            <p>The lovers whose loved<br>
                Had found another,<br>
                While the lover woefully<br>
                Resign to memories.</p>
<br>
            <p>The lovers who infuse themselves<br>
                Within their loved,<br>
                The lovers known by their loved,<br>
                The lovers that learn to love,<br>
                The lovers that grow with their love.</p>
<br>
            <p>The lovers hurt by love,<br>
                The lovers misfit,<br>
                The lovers declared misfit,<br>
                The lovers forcibly part,<br>
                The lovers who love,<br>
                While tethered to other in name.</p>
<br>
            <p>The lovers that stay,<br>
                With the love that harms,<br>
                The lovers that take the love,<br>
                And blind to the hurt.</p>
<br>
            <p>The lovers ashamed to love,<br>
                They who shatter their loved,<br>
                They who cage their loved,<br>
                And repent as they flee.</p>
<br>
            <p>The lovers as<br>
                Providers and receivers,<br>
                The providers who feel full,<br>
                At their receivers' joy,<br>
                Assuring each other of their love.</p>
<br>
            <p>The unpaired,<br>
                Afraid of love.<br>
                The unrequited love,<br>
                Whose love in vain,<br>
                Whose sentiment pains.</p>
<br>
            <p>The wandering eye sees it all,<br>
                As it trails about in its vicinity,<br>
                It smiles at every one of the pair,<br>
                The eye that makes the heart wonder,<br>
                What kind of lover would I be?</p>
