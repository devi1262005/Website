           <p>Turbulent mind,<br>
Turbulent mind,<br>
midst the stilled life,<br>
unchanged, as then,<br>
as now.</p>
<br>
<p>The mind that races,<br>
creates a turbulent world,<br>
and races against it,<br>
but life around is always still.</p>
<br>
<p>The worn, out restless body,<br>
that does not indulge itself,<br>
in the placid world,<br>
clutches itself at night,<br>
tossing and turning,<br>
as it braces itself,<br>
for another restless day.</p>
<br>
<p>The life as stilled as ever,<br>
the wind as breezy as ever,<br>
the sun as warm as ever,<br>
the birds as chirpy as ever,<br>
the turbulent mind, as worried as ever.</p>
<br>
<p>All that cannot be helped,<br>
'It is a fast-paced world',<br>
it says to itself,<br>
as it frightens itself,<br>
unmoving as it lies,<br>
awake in the nightmare,<br>
it created for itself.</p>
<br>
<p>The body wishes for,<br>
flower-bed and stars,<br>
the mind races about,<br>
death-bed and scars,<br>
as they race against,<br>
the tranquil world.</p>
