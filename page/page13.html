                    <p>
                        The four walls,<br>
                        The chairs,<br>
                        The television,<br>
                        The radio,<br>
                        That aged with me.
                    </p>
<br>
                    <p>
                        The four walls that absorbed my laughter,<br>
                        Saw me in good and bad;<br>
                        The radio that hid my cries;<br>
                        The television that diverted the pain;<br>
                        The chairs I kicked at, sat in;<br>
                        Everything in my house<br>
                        That saw me more than anyone did.
                    </p>
<br>
                    <p>
                        The bed I lied in;<br>
                        The no longer soft bed;<br>
                        That I lied awake and slept well in;<br>
                        The bed I shared the daydreams and nightmares with;<br>
                        The bed that was warm and cold for me;<br>
                        With fuzzy dreams, happy thoughts;<br>
                        With fever dreams, gloomy thoughts;<br>
                        The bed that I had always ended my day with.
                    </p>
<br>
                    <p>
                        I lied awake with rose-tinted cheeks;<br>
                        I lied awake crying about unfairness;<br>
                        I lied awake and soaked the bed with tears;<br>
                        I lied awake talking to objects;<br>
                        Whose silence bode me well than people;<br>
                        I am always well accompanied.
                    </p>
<br>
                    <p>
                        All the objects,<br>
                        The object of my emotions;<br>
                        The serenity of never-changing objects, <br>
                        In the ever-changing circumstances,<br>
                        Should I thank my parents for not replacing them?<br>
                        Or should I worry about them collapsing?<br>
                        Seems as though they too are overwrought as I.
