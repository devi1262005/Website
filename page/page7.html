        <p>
            A tender moment lived,<br>
            Is a moment stored,<br>
            In every place,<br>
            In every face.
        </p>
<br>
        <p>
            A moment passing,<br>
            Becomes fleeting,<br>
            Becomes longing,<br>
            Hoping to touch,<br>
            Longing to clutch.
        </p>
<br>
        <p>
            An impossible feat,<br>
            Achieved by a passing stranger;<br>
            Stranger who lives their present;<br>
            Somehow strikingly similar to the watcher's past;<br>
            Blend of blissful unawareness;<br>
            The watched and the watcher.
        </p>
<br>
        <p>
            Both live the same life,<br>
            For a brief splitting moment;<br>
            Till the present pulls the watcher,<br>
            Out of their trance.
        </p>
<br>
        <p>
            The watcher;<br>
            Desperate to find similarities,<br>
            The urge to predict;<br>
			Trying to make it easy for the watched; <br>
            Hoping it's the same as how it was;<br>
            Gushing out words;<br>
            Feigning enjoyment;<br>
            While it was a little less felt.<br>
            Feigning familiarity;<br>
            When all they felt were lost.
        </p>
<br>
        <p>
            The innate desire,<br>
            To live the spent moment time again,<br>
            With increasing desire each time;<br>
            To spectate the same through another,<br>
            The joy of familiarity and assumption,<br>
            Takes away the pain of uncertain.
        </p>
