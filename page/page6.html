        <p>
            The vast trees spread so lovely on the mountain bed,
            perhaps remind me that it's not too bad to just depend,
            not fearing, not doubting,
        </p>
		<br>
        <p>
            If the trees were 'blessed' with the ability to reason
            would they have grown?
            If the trees, creepers, or the flower bed had thought,
            "What if the mountain crumbles?"
        </p>
		<br>
        <p>
            Would anyone be able to spectate the beautiful scenery
            etched with the mountain today?
            If the mountain had thoughts, would it have thought
            that it was being overshadowed by the greenness?
        </p>
        <p>
            What if the mountain had assessed its grandeur and ability
            to hold them all?
            Would this scenery be here today?
        </p>
		<br>
        <p>
            Would it have felt any pain unbearable when the trees or
            even the minuscule plant pierced through its rock?
            Would it have stopped when it became too unbearable?
        </p>
		<br>
        <p>
            When it would have felt like nothing comes out of it?
            Would it have felt arrogant to be the livelihood of
            thousands of habitats?
        </p>
		<br>
        <p>
            Or would it feel insufficient or insecure in its ability
            to hold them all?
        </p>
		<br>
        <p>
            A creation made from shaking up the core,
            it could have well been just a huge piece of rock formed,
        </p>
        <p>
            The habitat, the life all found itself on its own on the
            very rock not intended,
        </p>
		<br>
        <p>
            But nonetheless became a beautiful sight to behold.
            Just how beautiful it feels to be free, be one's own self?
        </p>
		<br>
        <p>
            Undoubting and just existing?
            Without any fear of falling apart?
        </p>
		<br>
        <p>
            Oh, how beautiful it is to depend and have a shine of our own?
        </p>
		<br>
        <p>
            How amazing it is to be reliable?
            And how would it be if I were able to have this?
        </p>
