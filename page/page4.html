        <p>
            Dreading the days,<br>
            Treading through time,<br>
            As each day quickly passes by,<br>
            Never understanding how I held through.
        </p>
<br>
        <p>
            When a time once lived,<br>
            Reaches its end,<br>
            Marked as done,<br>
            I find myself living those days<br>
            In my head,<br>
            In solitude,<br>
            The days dreaded becomes the desired.
        </p>
<br>
        <p>
            I find myself living those days<br>
            Looking back with a longing gaze,<br>
            Gushing about it in a daze,<br>
            Immortalizing the times lived,<br>
            A foolish endeavor that<br>
            Gives me peace.
        </p>
<br>
        <p>
            Perhaps, it's the comfort of known ending,<br>
            Rather than pondering the impending doom,<br>
            Mind never set in the present,<br>
            Always floating in the past,<br>
            An utter imbecile,<br>
            That wouldn't survive a day<br>
            If she actually lived, the day.
