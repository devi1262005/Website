        <p>
            Everything in my life is<br><br>
            A repetition of itself,<br><br>
            And yet it still leaves me<br><br>
            Unguided and anxious,<br><br>
            Looking back it all seems easy,<br><br>
            But then why am I so hopeless?<br><br>
        </p>

        <p>
            The predictable pattern keeps revealing itself,<br><br>
            Like a painting hidden, with a transparent veil,<br><br>
            And everytime, it leaves me stunned no less than before,<br><br>
            Will I ever be free from this predicament<br><br>
            Of repetition?<br><br>
            I never seem to get used to it.
        </p>
