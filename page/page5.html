        <p>
            Existence,<br>
            To exist, is so painful.<br>
            It's so dreadful, that I cannot<br>
            Breathe without thinking about the<br>
            People I suffocated with my presence,<br>
            I hate myself so much,<br>
            That I cannot exist within myself.
        </p>
<br>
        <p>
            I wish to jump out of skin,<br>
            Crawl out of my body,<br>
            Every ounce of this pain is so true.<br>
            I cannot feel anything towards me,<br>
            I cannot understand my pain,<br>
            I cannot hear myself,<br>
            I cannot see myself,<br>
            I cannot stop the tingling numbness of my skin,<br>
            I cannot stop faking that I can.
        </p>
<br>
        <p>
            I am split,<br>
            I exist in the mirror,<br>
            I exist in the air,<br>
            I exist in everyone's eye,<br>
            Yet I do not in mine.<br>
            I do not exist in my life,<br>
            I cease existing,<br>
            When I'm not around anyone.<br>
            I am a concept,<br>
            A concept that replays<br>
            Over and over,<br>
            However, the way you perceive.
        </p>
<br>
        <p>
            I cannot stand the thought of<br>
            Existing,<br>
            Being perceived,<br>
            I wish to be in camouflage,<br>
            Wish to vanish into thin air,<br>
            Wish to never show myself to the world,<br>
            Wish to never speak,<br>
            Wish to never hear myself,<br>
            Wish to never ever exist,<br>
            I exist to ruin,<br>
            I exist to unexist.
        </p>
<br>
        <p>
            To be or not to be?<br>
            I do not know,<br>
            I am a being,<br>
            For another being,<br>
            And I do not be,<br>
            For me.
        </p>
