            <p>What use of my life,<br>
                and its time,<br>
                If I do not have any means,<br>
                to lay and gaze at the stars?</p>
<br>
            <p>Whatever joy do I have,<br>
                If I cannot spectate the stars?<br>
                What curiosity it is,<br>
                If I do not marvel at the sky?<br>
                Am I really gushing in joy,<br>
                If I do not astound at the vastness?</p>
<br>
            <p>Is it really my home<br>
                If I must crane my neck,<br>
                Travel miles for minutes,<br>
                to glimpse my joyous sight?</p>
<br>
            <p>I miss my once home,<br>
                Where I could,<br>
                Lay my bones to rest,<br>
                And co-exist with the stars.</p>
<br>
            <p>I relentlessly toil to behold,<br>
                the sight that is mine.<br>
                A home where I can lay my body,<br>
                Indulge myself in the darkness,<br>
                Of the night sky,<br>
                Ignoring the weight of self.</p>
