                <p>
                    People, who run away from themselves,<br>
                    peer into otherâ€™s life,<br>
                    they rejoice at the familiarity,<br>
                    the urge to become,<br>
                    everything they did not have.<br>
                    Are those who lose themselves,<br>
                    in the quest of pleasing.
                </p>
<br>
                <p>
                    They who open their arms,<br>
                    before the first cry is heard.<br>
                    They who offer help,<br>
                    without advances,<br>
                    they who smile,<br>
                    without nuances.
                </p>
<br>
                <p>
                    They who became all,<br>
                    that they had needed once,<br>
                    they who morph into family,<br>
                    for the peers.
                </p>
<br>
                <p>
                    They who never utter without thought,<br>
                    hurting, but never hurt,<br>
                    they who lie awake at night,<br>
                    pondering interactions.<br>
                    They who become the sweetest,<br>
                    they who become the joyful,<br>
                    they who become everything they<br>
                    wished they had by their side.
                </p>
<br>
                <p>
                    They who change,<br>
                    with the people,<br>
                    with circumstances,<br>
                    they who are always on the run,<br>
                    they who shall never face themselves,<br>
                    they who no longer identify themselves,<br>
                    they who always morph,<br>
                    but never grow.
                </p>
<br>
                <p>
                    They who hope,<br>
                    to find themselves,<br>
                    amidst many faces,<br>
                    they wore and worn.
                </p>
