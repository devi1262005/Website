<p>
    Forgiveness, the greatest gift,<br>
    Art of forgiveness, gift bestowed by the creator,<br>
    Everyone says.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    Forgiveness is selfish,<br>
    It frees oneself,<br>
    Of the anger, grief, the pain of betrayal,<br>
    It is not for the other person to relish on.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    You cannot swallow back words spat,<br>
    Actions done,<br>
    A mere "I would be a better person,"<br>
    Wouldn't take it all,<br>
    For the better person would not be in my life, completely,<br>
    Rather someone else's.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    Forgiveness wouldn't result in lost trust gained,<br>
    The days cried, months wallowed in self-pity,<br>
    Months and days of questioning choices,<br>
    Overthinking, where it all went wrong,<br>
    The days won't be made better, or brought back.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    But rather, forgiveness, itself is beautiful because,<br>
    It shows the triedness of the weeping heart,<br>
    The heart that is done weeping ready to move on,<br>
    Not erasing the pain, or the good memories made,<br>
    Or treating the person like they did,<br>
    But rather, not let it impact anymore than it did.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    People with empty apologies,<br>
    Seeking grievances, for their shortcomings,<br>
    Trying to make you forgive,<br>
    Putting on a show of a dog with a tail between its legs,<br>
    Laughed at on the inside,<br>
    Forgiven loosely,<br>
    And pushed away as they should be.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    Forgiving people, who did not even ask for it,<br>
    Or have any idea of their actions,<br>
    Is even more difficult,<br>
    But the heart has decided to let go,<br>
    And it shall.
