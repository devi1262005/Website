        <p>
            A person, in general,<br>
            Shaped by their thoughts, actions,<br>
            But I'd rather were shaped by my parents,<br>
            Their wishes, their needs, and their happiness.
        </p>
<br>
        <p>
            Stay on top of the class,<br>
            The good girl reputation,<br>
            For my mother.
        </p>
<br>
        <p>
            The well-mannered, brave,<br>
            Raised well, the ideal daughter<br>
            Reputation, for my father.
        </p>
<br>
        <p>
            Keep running, with blurring finish line,<br>
            With a car that cannot rev up anymore,<br>
            Smokes and fumes from places where it shouldn't be,<br>
            Forcing myself to reach that line,<br>
            Just to see my mother's smile,<br>
            The upward curve,<br>
            That will make me ignore the curve of my back,<br>
            To be in a good place for her,<br>
            To make her be in a good place, from me.
        </p>
<br>
        <p>
            Trying to be the best, on all costs,<br>
            Harder on me, than my father ever will,<br>
            The car that's running on virtual energy,<br>
            From my father's hopes and wishes for me,<br>
            When I reach that line,<br>
            I hope I make him happy,<br>
            In a place where I earn better,<br>
            Be better, for him, something he wanted,<br>
            A good name for him, from me.
        </p>
<br>
        <p>
            And as for me,<br>
            Would I ever be happy?<br>
            What's left of me when I reach the line,<br>
            Proud hardworking parents,<br>
            Who would no longer work hard,<br>
            As they deserve,<br>
            The joy on my parent's faces,<br>
            What of me?
        </p>
<br>
        <p>
            Could I go on after this?<br>
            After I reached the point,<br>
            Which was everything I dreamt of,<br>
            And there will be no after or present,<br>
            Only before.<br>
            I had not dreamt of anything more than that.
        </p>
<br>
        <p>
            How would I be?<br>
            Would everything be dull and meaningless,<br>
            Or would I want more?<br>
            Without my parents wanting anything more?<br>
            I would never know,<br>
            Till I reach the line,<br>
            And I hope it's not far.
        </p>
<br>
        <p>
            The finish line,<br>
            That might just finish me,<br>
            And whatever I thought I was.
        </p>
