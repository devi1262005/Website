        <p>
            Festives,<br>
            Joy, happiness, togetherness;<br>
            All that it was for her -<br>
            She who loved people,<br>
            She who loved warmth,<br>
            She who did not know it was all played<br>
            For the watching eyes, and drawling mouths.
        </p>
<br>
        <p>
            They who acted,<br>
            They who laughed with people,<br>
            They cuss out in the dark,<br>
            They who found no reason to pretend anymore,<br>
            For she isn't so little,<br>
            And they are too old for the act.
        </p>
<br>
        <p>
            She who spectates the changes,<br>
            She who cannot fathom that these<br>
            Are the same customs, once followed,<br>
            Forced, now thrown and cast away.<br>
            She who cannot understand if this saddens<br>
            Or surprises her.
        </p>
<br>
        <p>
            They who finally feel free to show their true distaste.<br>
            They who find no more reason to hold it all together,<br>
            As she watches everything the little girl believed in crumble,<br>
            The best parts of the little girl's world,<br>
            No longer exist in hers,<br>
            There is nothing in this world,<br>
            Where she can find traces of the little girl,<br>
            Or share the same joy as the child.
        </p>
<br>
        <p>
            That everything the little girl knew was never ever real.<br>
            Everything the child knew was wrong,<br>
            Perhaps why the child ever so blissfully unaware in her,<br>
            Joyous as ever, the child dances and leaps;<br>
            As she does not want to kill her joy,<br>
            She pretends with the child too,<br>
            And takes a bite of the sweets,<br>
            Receives 'blessings', those sweet nothings,<br>
            With a bow, and a forced smile;<br>
            Soundly knowledgeable of the charade.
        </p>
