        <p>
            Stay, with me,<br>
            For me, by me,<br>
            The longing plea, unheard,<br>
            Whenever someone makes me feel happy and at ease.
        </p>

        <p>
            With each passing day,<br>
            The bond grows stronger,<br>
            With the heart like sinking stone,<br>
            Drowning in its insecurities and doubts.
        </p>

        <p>
            The other person,<br>
            Who does not deserve to be on the questioning end,<br>
            Yet still, my mind ponders,<br>
            My heart wavers.
        </p>

        <p>
            Though it's never them,<br>
            That makes me fear being stranded,<br>
            It's me, and the struck reminders of the past,<br>
            Relationships ruined, staggered.
        </p>

        <p>
            When I am with them,<br>
            Half a mind happy,<br>
            Half a mind trying to stay happy.<br>
            Half a heart full of life,<br>
            Other half full of doubts,<br>
            Bracing itself for the days to come,<br>
            Where they might not be present.
        </p>

        <p>
            People do not stay,<br>
            But the emotion does,<br>
            People leave,<br>
            The days of joy, happiness, sadness,<br>
            Those days are mine, were a part of my life,<br>
            Routines change, but they still are a part of a routine.
</p>
        <p>
            Once greet them, now avoid them,<br>
            Past stays, and it's a painful reminder,<br>
            Of what could have been,<br>
            What was lost.
        </p>

        <p>
            But the people now in the present,<br>
            Do not deserve to be viewed with suspicion,<br>
            I hate the way I perceive my current people,<br>
            With a marred lens of the past.
</p>
        <p>
            I cannot really help it,<br>
            After all, I am still the little girl,<br>
            That spent countless nights,<br>
            Observing the raise and fall of my parents' chest,<br>
            In their sleep,<br>
            In fear they might leave me, for God.
        </p>

        <p>
            I, though, realize,<br>
            I cannot make anyone stay, if they do not want to,<br>
            Or can make anyone I cherish leave, because of my fears,<br>
            And that death, the inevitable, cannot be avoided.
        </p>

        <p>
            Is it wrong to need a rock,<br>
            In the middle of the crashing waves?<br>
            The rock that just stays firm,<br>
            Amidst the chaos of waves?<br>
            Could I be accepted without a camouflage?<br>
            Would anyone stay?
        </p>

        <p>
            Does the rock deserve the chaos?<br>
            And the overwhelming clashing of the waves?<br>
            It doesn't,<br>
            So it crumbles,<br>
            Unregrettably the waves still crash,<br>
            Against parts of itself, more intensely,<br>
            With nothing to ground,<br>
            The rock no longer present.
        </p>

        <p>
            The fear of being abandoned,<br>
            The crippling weight of doubts,<br>
            Never truly happy, always bracing,<br>
            This is tiring, and I do not know how to stop it.
