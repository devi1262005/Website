                Will it rain today?<br>
                Would it present itself with new matters to worry?<br>
                Would I find myself once again lost?<br>
                Would it present me with new routines?<br>
                Would I have to sail in deeper depths?<br>
                Are the sharks waiting?<br>
                Is it never-ending?<br>
                Would I count every second of this?<br>
                Hoping for the light in the depths?
            </p>
<br>
            <p>
                Will it rain today?<br>
                Would it bring me immense joy;<br>
                And make me look up;<br>
                Enjoy as it pours and it pours?<br>
                Would I join my hands together hoping to get<br>
                Enough of it all?<br>
                Would it be blissful?<br>
                Would I count every second of this?<br>
                Hoping for forever?<br>
                Would it make me greedy till I drown?
            </p>
<br>
            <p>
                Would I rather be the drenched?<br>
                Or the deflector?<br>
                Dawn to dusk I ponder;<br>
                "Will it rain today?".
