            <p>Earth, creates,<br>
                Creatures, survive,<br>
                Humans, exploit.</p>

            <p>Wonder if this the way it should have been,<br>
                That the mountains, trees, oceans,<br>
                Were they formed to quench thirst?<br>
                Give shade? Provide a place to rest?<br>
                Or were they just formed simply because it could be?</p>
<br>
            <p>Pondering this way,<br>
                Makes me realise that maybe we were too created<br>
                To just simply exist, be what we are, truly,<br>
                Without looking for purpose aimlessly,<br>
                And maybe we would realise our true purpose,<br>
                Or our purpose could just find us,<br>
                Much like how we found oceans, trees,<br>
                For us, and call it the nature's purpose,<br>
                Is it truly?</p>
<br>
            <p>Would we call nature's elements beautiful,<br>
                If they have no purpose to us?<br>
                Doesn't this show the marred view of humanity?<br>
                Goodness of a person, always determined by<br>
                How helpful they are,<br>
                Simply existing humans, are unfit, lazy.</p>
<br>
            <p>By just staying, loving and giving,<br>
                We could find our purpose,<br>
                Just maybe,<br>
                Or call this a bluff,<br>
                I do not know.</p>
