        <p>
            As I walk down the street,<br>
            My eyes wander searching for the pair of familiar eyes,<br>
            That would be shining with warmth, directed my way.<br>
            With a thumping heart and twiddling fingers,<br>
            I walk towards her.
        </p>

        <p>
            The moment I reach her,<br>
            And the familiar tone of her voice reflecting kindness,<br>
            The kindness, that her eyes speak louder,<br>
            With me greeting her back shyly, with watery eyes, every time.<br>
            The beat of my heart becomes louder;<br>
            Than the gratitude I could ever muster up to show her.
        </p>

        <p>
            Each day she gifts me,<br>
            Something from her shop,<br>
            Which I decline saying I do not deserve for I do not pay,<br>
            She disagrees with  one  of her brightest smiles,<br>
            Which I return with my cheek hurting.<br>
            Somedays, it's just one of her smiles,<br>
            That I gladly beam back, lost energy back with full force,<br>
            These interactions that will forever make my day,<br>
            I'm revived after getting drained by university.
        </p>

        <p>
            This brief moment with her,<br>
            Always making me realize I'm loved,<br>
            I'm loved as I ever can be,<br>
            The kind of love that's so reliving,<br>
            Because it comes from a place where I did not prove myself.
        </p>

        <p>
            That I too am capable of loving,<br>
            In a different way, than I'm being showed love,<br>
            That I do not have to strive to reciprocate the same way,<br>
            Even if I reciprocate her kindness with a red-tinted cheek and a bright smile,<br>
            Without giving anything back for what she gives me,<br>
            She would always say "I like you".
        </p>
