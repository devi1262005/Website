            <p>Oh Hamster on the wheel,<br>
                Do you feel excitement?<br>
                Do you feel dread?<br>
                Have you ever imagined jumping?<br>
                Had you ever imagined not spinning?<br>
                Are you a spectator of your own misery too?</p>
<br>
            <p>Creature on the wheel,<br>
                Do you know of the people you spin for?<br>
                Had you chosen to spin?<br>
                For every time you spin,<br>
                Had you imagined a tireless existence?<br>
                Do you realize your helplessness being spectated?<br>
                Had you imagined a world beyond your control?</p>
<br>
            <p>Oh Hamster,<br>
                Every day you run,<br>
                Every day you chase the circle,<br>
                Every day you hope for an end,<br>
                And every day, every time,<br>
                For all the every's,<br>
                Hidden is a never.</p>
<br>
            <p>You shall never find your end,<br>
                You shall spin every day,<br>
                The end, you desperately,<br>
                Toil for, hurt for.<br>
                Do you find solace in the predictability?<br>
                Hamster oh hamster?<br>
                Whatever reason were you chosen for,<br>
                You made peace with your fate.</p>
<br>
            <p>Though,<br>
                Don't you wish,<br>
                You could stop instead,<br>
                To leap instead,<br>
                And not chase the never-ending end?</p>
<br>
            <p>I somehow find myself in your wheels too,<br>
                Every phase of mine,<br>
                A new wheel,<br>
                The old one discarded,<br>
                As a fond memory to recall,<br>
                For my spectators.</p>
<br>
            <p>As I spin endlessly in those new wheels,<br>
                Hoping to be tire of them,<br>
                A new one shapes its way in,<br>
                I wish I wasn't the one for the wheels,<br>
                I wish I was for the life of uncertainty,<br>
                Right and wrong, wrong or right.<br>
                I do not wish for everything to be known,<br>
                I do not wish to sigh or resign,<br>
                And watch it all unfold itself,<br>
                A new play, old title.<br>
                Playing the lead, or the seer.</p>
<br>
            <p>I wish the wheels for my feet,<br>
                That my paths shall never intertwine,<br>
                Every dawn, every dusk, <br>
                There shall be only one of its kind, <br>
                A whirlwind of endless running, tumbling,<br>
                Toppling, nothing shall be laid out.<br>
                I hope for a dawn where I know not.</p>
<br>
            <p>The predictability of my predicament,<br>
                Is never-ending,<br>
                And it's so wrenching, hamster,<br>
                How could they let you do it for laughs?</p>
