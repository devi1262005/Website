            <p>When we first turned our pages together,<br>
            we laughed, made promises.</p>
            <p>With each new turn,<br>
            was a spur of happiness,<br>
            we had never imagined it,<br>
            had never braced ourselves,<br>
            there was sunshine,<br>
            then came the moonshine,<br>
            your love had withered,<br>
            While I, lingered in the moonlight.</p>
			<br>
            <p>Perhaps, that is why you decided<br>
            to turn our final pages.<br>
            Have you no reason to warn me?</p>
            <p>You were there this time again,<br>
            as a grim stranger,<br>
            with broken promises,<br>
            and unsaid words,<br>
            the final page fluttered away,<br>
            when you swiftly walked out,<br>
            of us.</p>
