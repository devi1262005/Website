                Is fake happiness better than real sadness?<br>
                Can't be faithful to yourself,<br>
                Why do you neglect yourself,<br>
                Just because other people do?
            </p>

            <p>
                Why would you put yourself through that?<br>
                Have you ever thought about<br>
                How it is so much easier to cry,<br>
                Than just smile when you couldn't?<br>
                You are still sad,<br>
                Why not let go?
            </p>

            <p>
                Why not muster up the courage?<br>
                It must be difficult in front of other people,<br>
                Who do not put the effort to know you,<br>
                Stay when happy, leave when sad,<br>
                Those are the people around you,<br>
                Then why can't you be the person you need, for yourself?
            </p>

            <p>
                Break when alone,<br>
                It is okay to break when alone,<br>
                Put on a facade for others,<br>
                Do not put a facade for yourself,<br>
                See you, in the mirror,<br>
                Do not see what everyone else sees.
</p>
            <p>
                Break down willingly,<br>
                Instead of breaking unwillingly,<br>
                So that you would have courage to build yourself up,<br>
                Instead of turning deaf to your own weeps.<br>
                Tread on a weak foundation,<br>
                That could be improved,<br>
                Do not tread on a shaky foundation,<br>
                That could break anytime,<br>
                Though looking perfect.
