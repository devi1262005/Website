            <p>
    To all the people that I forgot unintentionally,<br>
    Those who could have wondered,<br>
    "What happened to this girl who wouldn't stop talking?"<br>
    I'm sorry for falling out suddenly,<br>
    I could have been tired,<br>
    Or supporting the weight of my limbs mentally,<br>
    While my body couldn't.
</p>

<p>
    I could be running on low energy,<br>
    While my mind is racing with thoughts,<br>
    On how should I be and what I should be during that time.<br>
    I did not mean to forget you,<br>
    Your presence in my life is not insignificant,<br>
    I value you so much,<br>
    Even if my actions don't mean the same.
</p>

<p>
    Some days, I forget myself,<br>
    How to eat, how to sleep,<br>
    How not to just be a starfish,<br>
    As I lie awake in my bed,<br>
    Not being able to move my limb,<br>
    I think of you, and when I do it's already a month late,<br>
    What should I say then? I just apologetically,<br>
    Seemingly unapologetic, delete the message,<br>
    Pretending it doesn't exist,<br>
    Like my will to go on some days.
</p>

<p>
    The excuses I spew, laughable to my own ears,<br>
    I wonder how convincing they seem to you?<br>
    I know how my mind would be racing with thoughts,<br>
    Had I been ignored like that,<br>
    I hope you do not value a person like me so much,<br>
    Spare yourself of the pain.
</p>

<p>
    And as I go on wondering about my ability to make<br>
    Meaningful connections,<br>
    I look at the people who could have been my friends,<br>
    If I had mustered up the energy to just talk, each day,<br>
    Reached out when they did,<br>
    Sounds like I took people for granted,<br>
    Turned friends to acquaintances,<br>
    Ruining things, what I do the best.
</p>

<p>
    Some of the forgotten acquaintances, forever remembered,<br>
    Always forgotten during the times I should have remembered.<br>
    Bitter-sweet memories, hardly sweet,<br>
    Some of the others' existence though often remembered,<br>
    When I run into them and not otherwise,<br>
    Shows how much of a terrible being I am.
</p>

<p>
    I apologize terribly,<br>
    You do not deserve someone like me,<br>
    She who lets herself get consumed,<br>
    Not replying to a concerned friend,<br>
    Doesn't deserve a friend at all,<br>
    But you still reply back whenever I message you anyway,<br>
    Thank you for always reaching out,<br>
    I apologize if I ever made you doubt your place in my life,<br>
    I always hold you close to my heart,<br>
    Even if I do not seem so.
</p>

<p>
    Even these excuses sound pathetic to my own ears,<br>
    For, if I wanted to I could have,<br>
    But that's really not the case,<br>
    I really want to, but mustering up energy,<br>
    Requires energy, this doesn't mean you are consuming,<br>
    It's me, the weight of me consuming myself,<br>
    That everything else darkens out,<br>
    Like my memory and the ability to just open up.<br>
    I'm sorry, you deserve better,<br>
    And I know there are better people than I for you,<br>
    And I'm thankful for that.
</p>
