        <p>
            Sway, <br><br>
            so easily swayed, <br><br>
            like the entire colony surrounding <br><br>
            a granule of sugar, <br><br>
            like the pet that runs after a <br><br>
            ridiculous object, upon hearing "fetch."<br><br>
        </p>

        <p>
            The sway that gets the best of us, <br><br>
            that you never look past, <br><br>
            like the rat that walks into its trap, <br><br>
            the insatiable desire <br><br>
            to be felt, seen, and understood.<br><br>
        </p>

        <p>
            Never makes the best of us realize, <br><br>
            till the end of it is seen through, <br><br>
            with a deeper scar, that requires more tending, <br><br>
            You let yourself fly again, <br><br>
            like the dried leaf on the ground, <br><br>
            everywhere but nowhere.
        </p>
    </div>
</body>
