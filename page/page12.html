        <p>
            As I look up, I see the broad sky,<br>
            The sky that never crumbles,<br>
            The sky that always finds its way to shine light,<br>
            Amidst the clouds.
        </p>
		<br><br>
        <p>
            The sky that, despite shrouded by darkness,<br>
            To rain, as one would call it crying and grieving,<br>
            The very sky which shows me that crying too<br>
            Can sometimes make your heart feel light and sound,<br>
            Just as the rain makes the plants and the people rejoice with joy,<br>
            The heart too will be thankful for the burden released with sound,<br>
            For it does not feel alone in its pain validated by its beholder.
        </p><br><br>
        <p>
            Just like how after the roaring of thunder,<br>
            The light follows.<br>
            The grieving heart follows the light of the consoling words<br>
            Offered by its companions,<br>
            That companionship though can only be achieved,<br>
            If the heart can roar like thunder,<br>
            Unafraid to ask for help,<br>
            Isn't that humorous?
        </p><br><br>
        <p>
            The pitch-dark night sky shows its stars hung up beautifully,<br>
            Which most people would sleep on,<br>
            The ones that stay hidden to the eye in the morning,<br>
            Isn't that synchronous with the saying "you shine when it's your time"?<br>
            Or is that synchronous with the saying "beauty lies in the eye of the beholder"?
        </p><br><br>
        <p>
            Perhaps people only stay with you during times of joy,<br>
            The splendid bright sky,<br>
            They never stay with you during your darkest,<br>
            That they never get to see those unhidden parts of you,<br>
            The stars that so beautifully ignite with undying courage and determination,<br>
            Even though you hardly feel it some days,<br>
            Like a dimming star,<br>
            It serves as a reminder of what was,<br>
            And makes room for what will be.
        </p><br><br>
        <p>
            The stars concealed by the brightness of the daylight,<br>
            The stars that only show up during the darkness of the night,<br>
            These contrasts are too what makes you, you.<br>
            Just like how some places face the darkness of the moon,<br>
            And the brightness of the sun,<br>
            In the same planet at the same time,<br>
            People do too,<br>
            Some see you glowing in the face of dark,<br>
            Some see you glowing in the face of light,<br>
            Based on where you hold them to your heart.<br>
            And that is alright.
