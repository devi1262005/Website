        <p>
            I try to survive;<br> <br>
            Like the goat that doesn't know it's about to be killed,<br><br>
            Like the mice that doesn't know it's about to get trapped,<br><br>
            Like the clown that doesn't know that they are being laughed at,<br><br>
            So full of clues,<br><br>
            So full of problems,<br><br>
            So full of hopes,<br><br>
            So full yet never enough,<br><br>
            No matter what role I play,<br><br>
            Nothing ever fits,<br><br>
            Fate a cruelly crafted circle.
